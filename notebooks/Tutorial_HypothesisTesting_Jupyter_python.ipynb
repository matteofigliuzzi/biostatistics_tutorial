It allows you to input the URL of any public Git repository, and it will open that repository within the native Jupyter Notebook interface. You can run any notebooks in the repository, though any changes you make will not be saved back to the repository. You don't have to create an account with Binder and you don't need to be the owner of the repository, though the repository must include a configuration file that specifies its package requirements. The dependency files are used by Binder be used to build a Docker image, where all configurations and dependencies to run the notebook are already satisfied.\n",

Even some Windows computers (notably those from HP) now come with Python already installed.

    "With regard to normality, the measurement responses appear to be somewhat skewed to the right. The median values are less than the mean values, consistent with a slight skew. This might be a violation of the assumption of normality. The responses for the mutant also appear to be slightly bimodal. Student's t-test is robust to small deviations from normality so it is unclear if these departures from normality will be a problem.\n",

    "The skew in the response is the more serious violation because if it cannot be corrected then we will need to use a non-parametric test with lower power. Right-skewed distributions can sometimes be corrected using a natural log. Note that the function np.log() in python defaults to the natural log, which is commonly written as ln."

    "We will now run the glm() function on the data. We need to tell the glm() function which variable is the response variable and which variables are treatment variables. This is done in R by putting the response variable to the left of a tilda symbol and the treatment variables to the right of the tilda symbol with plus signs between treatment variables. The glm() function also needs to know what kind of regression we plan to do. Because our response variable is a binary categorical variable, the appropriate type of regression is called logistic regression. We specify this by telling glm() to use a binomial error distribution. The binomial distribution quantifies the probability of a binary outcome, like flipping a coin to get heads versus tails. Here, the binary outcome is ciliated versus not, and the logistic regression model is a way to allow the probability of being ciliated to depend on genotype and day."

    "The section of the glm() function output that we are most interested in is the coefficients. The line that starts with \"GenotypeTrisomic\" tells us about the effect of genotype. The magnitude of the effect of being Trisomic vs Disomic is 1.2705. This coefficient is calculated as the natural log of the odds ratio. A Wald test was run on this coefficient to determine if it is a significant departure from what would be expected if there was no effect of genotype. The Wald test is based on z-scores. Dividing the coefficient by the standard error results in a z-score of 7.933 which has a p-value of 2.14e-15. So genotype has a very significant effect on the proportion of cells with cilia.\n",

    "Simiarly, there were significant effects of what day the experiment was conducted on. Day2 and Day3 were both significantly different from Day1. Although the effect of day was not of interest, by including it as a variable in the model we were able to estimate and therefore control for significant variation in the proportion of cells with cilia across days. Controling for the day effect allowed us to more accurately estimate the effect and significance of genotype.\n",

It is very common to see this kind of data displayed as a bar graph with proportion or percentage on the y-axis and the different treatment categories on the x-axis.

    "An Odds Ratio plot is an excellent way to convey the effect of a binary categorical treatment variable on a binary categorical response variable. In this case the Odds Ratio = (Ciliated Disomic / Not Ciliated Disomic) / (Ciliated Trisomic / Not Ciliated Trisomic). As mentioned above, the coefficient estimated for GenotypeTrisomic is the natural log of the odds ratio. So the inverse natural log (i.e. 'e') of the coefficient is the odds ratio. Although it was not printed out to the screen, the glm() function also calculated the 95% confidence interval for the coefficient, which can also be converted to an odds ratio using the inverse natural log."

The summary() function provides the results we seek. ANOVA runs what is called an F-test. Large values of F mean that the differences in responses amongst treatments are large compared to differences in responses within treatments. F values close to 1 mean that the differences in responses amongst treatments are similar to differences in responses within treatments. In our case, we got an F value of 28.68, which is very large and has a very significant p-value of 2.7e-16.
