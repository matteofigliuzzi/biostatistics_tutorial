The magnitude of the effect of being affected by SCD is 0.99. This coefficient is calculated as the natural log of the odds ratio. A Wald test was run on this coefficient to determine if it is a significant departure from what would be expected if there was no effect of genotype. The Wald test is based on z-scores. Dividing the coefficient by the standard error results in a z-score of 2.26 which has a p-value < 0.025. So SCD has a significant effect on the probability of low AMH.\n",
