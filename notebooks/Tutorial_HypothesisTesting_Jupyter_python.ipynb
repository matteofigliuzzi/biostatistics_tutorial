The magnitude of the effect of being affected by SCD is 0.99. This coefficient is calculated as the natural log of the odds ratio. A Wald test was run on this coefficient to determine if it is a significant departure from what would be expected if there was no effect of genotype. The Wald test is based on z-scores.
