    "# Example 5: ANOVA with Tukey-Kramer Post-hoc\n",
    "In this example there is a categorical treatment variable and a continuous numerical response variable, just like the first two examples. However, in this example, the categorical treatment variable has four groups, three RNAi treatments and one control treatment.\n",
    "\n",
    "The biological hypothesis is that RNAi against all three members of the ZLW gene family results in decreased fluorescence intensity of a reporter. A common mistake is to perform a series of t-tests, which does not control the false positive rate at or below 0.05. If all six pairwise comparisons were made using t-tests, the false positive rate would be capped at 6 x 0.05 = 0.3, which is quite high. A single ANOVA test can be run to determine if any of the mean responses across treatments are different. The null hypothesis is that the mean responses are the same across all treatments. If we reject this null hypothesis from the ANOVA, we can then run a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc analysis to determine which pairs of treatments are significantly different. And all of that can be done while keeping the false positive rate no higher than 0.05.\n",
