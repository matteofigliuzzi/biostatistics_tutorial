If all six pairwise comparisons were made using t-tests, the false positive rate would be capped at 6 x 0.05 = 0.3, which is quite high. A single ANOVA test can be run to determine if any of the mean responses across treatments are different. The null hypothesis is that the mean responses are the same across all treatments. If we reject this null hypothesis from the ANOVA, we can then run a Tukey-Kramer post-hoc analysis to determine which pairs of treatments are significantly different.
